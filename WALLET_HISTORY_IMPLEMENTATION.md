# Driver Wallet History Implementation Guide

## Overview
This implementation adds wallet transaction history viewing capabilities for both **Sponsors** and **Admins** in the Safe Driver Program Django application. This allows them to monitor and review all wallet transactions for drivers in their organization.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Django Models (`models.py`)
Added two new models to handle wallet functionality:

#### `DriverWallet`
- Represents a driver's point wallet
- Fields: `wallet_id`, `driver`, `points_balance`, `is_active`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `last_transaction_date`
- One-to-one relationship with drivers (each driver has one wallet)

#### `WalletTransactionHistory`
- Stores all wallet transactions
- Transaction types: `adjustment`, `refund`, `purchase`, `reward`, `penalty`
- Tracks: points amount, balance before/after, sponsor/admin who made the change
- Reference types: `order`, `sponsor_reward`, `admin_adjustment`, etc.
- Status tracking: `pending`, `completed`, `failed`, `cancelled`

### 2. View Functions (`views.py`)
Added two main view functions:

#### `sponsor_wallet_history(request, driver_id=None)`
**Purpose:** Allows sponsors to view wallet history for their sponsored drivers

**Features:**
- Lists all drivers sponsored by the logged-in sponsor
- Shows wallet balance and last transaction date for each driver
- Filter by specific driver to see detailed transaction history
- Displays transaction details: type, amount, date, status, who processed it
- Access control: Only sponsors can access this view

**URL Patterns:**
- `/sponsor/wallet-history/` - View all sponsored drivers
- `/sponsor/wallet-history/<driver_id>/` - View specific driver's transaction history

#### `admin_wallet_history(request, driver_id=None)`
**Purpose:** Allows admins to view wallet history for all drivers in the system

**Features:**
- Lists all drivers with wallets in the system
- Shows overall statistics (total transactions, points added/deducted)
- Filter by specific driver for detailed transaction history
- Shows transaction breakdown by type (rewards, purchases, penalties, etc.)
- Displays sponsor organization for each driver
- Full transaction details with all metadata
- Access control: Only admins can access this view

**URL Patterns:**
- `/useradmin/wallet-history/` - View all drivers
- `/useradmin/wallet-history/<driver_id>/` - View specific driver's transaction history

### 3. URL Routes (`urls.py`)
Added four new URL patterns:
```python
path('sponsor/wallet-history/', views.sponsor_wallet_history, name='sponsor_wallet_history')
path('sponsor/wallet-history/<int:driver_id>/', views.sponsor_wallet_history, name='sponsor_wallet_history_driver')
path('useradmin/wallet-history/', views.admin_wallet_history, name='admin_wallet_history')
path('useradmin/wallet-history/<int:driver_id>/', views.admin_wallet_history, name='admin_wallet_history_driver')
```

### 4. HTML Templates
Created two new responsive templates using Bulma CSS:

#### `sponsor_wallet_history.html`
**Features:**
- Statistics dashboard (total drivers, current balance, total transactions)
- Dropdown selector to choose a driver
- Driver cards showing balance and last transaction
- Detailed transaction table with color-coded transaction types
- Filtering and navigation controls
- Responsive design

**UI Elements:**
- Success/danger tags for positive/negative point changes
- Status indicators (completed, pending, failed)
- Transaction type badges (reward, purchase, penalty, etc.)
- Back navigation to driver management page

#### `admin_wallet_history.html`
**Features:**
- Overall system statistics (total drivers, transactions, points flow)
- Comprehensive driver list with wallet information
- Transaction breakdown by type with statistics
- Full transaction details table
- Sponsor information for each transaction
- Admin action tracking
- Advanced filtering options

**UI Elements:**
- Multi-column statistics display
- Color-coded transaction types and statuses
- Detailed metadata display (reference IDs, IP addresses, notes)
- Sortable and searchable tables
- Pagination support (limits to 100 recent transactions)

### 5. Navigation Updates
Updated existing templates to include links to wallet history:

#### `sponsor_home.html`
- Added "Wallet History" button to quick actions

#### `sponsor_drivers.html`
- Added "View Wallet History" button at top of page

#### `admin_driver_list.html`
- Added "View Wallet History" button for admin access

## Database Schema
The implementation works with these SQL tables (already defined in your DDL files):

### `driver_wallets` Table
```sql
- wallet_id (Primary Key)
- driver_id (Foreign Key to users)
- points_balance (Integer, default 0)
- is_active (Boolean, default TRUE)
- created_at, updated_at, last_transaction_date (Timestamps)
```

### `wallet_transaction_history` Table
```sql
- transaction_id (Primary Key)
- wallet_id, driver_id (Foreign Keys)
- transaction_type, points_amount, points_before, points_after
- description, reference_id, reference_type
- sponsor_id, admin_id (Foreign Keys, nullable)
- status, transaction_date, processed_by
- notes, ip_address
```

## How to Use

### For Sponsors:
1. Log in as a sponsor user
2. Go to "Sponsor Dashboard"
3. Click "Wallet History" or navigate to "Manage Drivers" → "View Wallet History"
4. Select a driver from the dropdown to view their transaction history
5. Review transactions: type, amount, date, and who processed it

### For Admins:
1. Log in as an admin user
2. Go to "All Drivers" page
3. Click "View Wallet History"
4. See overview of all drivers and system statistics
5. Select a specific driver to see detailed transaction history
6. View transaction breakdowns and statistics

## Security & Access Control
- **Sponsors**: Can only view wallet history for drivers they sponsor (verified via `sponsor_driver_relationships` table)
- **Admins**: Can view all drivers' wallet history
- **Drivers**: Currently cannot view their own wallet history (can be added later)
- Session-based authentication checks in each view
- SQL injection protection via parameterized queries

## Next Steps & Enhancements

### Recommended Future Features:
1. **Driver Self-View**: Allow drivers to view their own wallet history
2. **Export Functionality**: Add CSV/PDF export for transaction reports
3. **Date Range Filtering**: Filter transactions by date range
4. **Transaction Search**: Search by description, reference ID, or amount
5. **Pagination**: Implement proper pagination for large transaction lists
6. **Charts & Graphs**: Visual representation of transaction trends
7. **Email Notifications**: Send alerts for large transactions or status changes
8. **Transaction Approval**: Multi-step approval process for large adjustments
9. **Audit Logging**: Track who viewed what wallet history and when
10. **Bulk Operations**: Admin ability to process multiple transactions at once

### Database Migrations:
Before using this feature in production, run:
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

### Required Database Tables:
Ensure the SQL tables are created:
```bash
# Run the DDL scripts from Database/DDL/ folder:
- driver_wallets.sql
- driver_wallet_history.sql
```

## Technical Details

### Query Optimization:
- Uses LEFT JOINs to handle missing wallet records gracefully
- Limits transaction history to most recent 100 records per driver
- Indexes on `driver_id`, `wallet_id`, `transaction_date` for fast queries

### Error Handling:
- Try-except blocks around all database operations
- User-friendly error messages via Django messages framework
- Fallback values for missing data
- Cursor cleanup in finally blocks

### Responsive Design:
- Mobile-friendly layouts using Bulma CSS
- Responsive tables with horizontal scrolling
- Touch-friendly buttons and controls
- Optimized for screens from mobile to desktop
